# Versus JS

There is a general conversation around jQuery that it is a "legacy" tool that has long since been replaced with ES6. This conversation seems to focus on features like ```document.querySelector()``` as "replacements" for what jQuery does. Many state that jQuery can be replaced by "four lines of utility code". 

This project is currently in the process of being updated to document the outcome of the conversation.
