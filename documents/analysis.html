        <p>Is jQuery still more productive? Or is jQuery dead? Has ES6 and modern DOM replaced it?</p>
        <p>These are the questions that I and most of X/Twitter have been wrestling with.</p>
        <p>Thanks to Travis Wagner’s submission we now how a clear understanding 
            on whether jQuery has been replaced or not. The surprising answer is it depends on 
            how you wrote your jQuery. The following two blocks of code are functionally equivalent:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="codeblocks">
        <div>
            <code class="javascript" min-width="468px">
            let div = $("&lt;div&gt;")
                .addClass(className)
                .css("font-weight", (selected ? "bold" : "normal"))
                .text("This is a test element);
                
            parentNode.empty().append(div);
            </code>
        </div>
        <div>
            <code class="javascript" min-width="468px">
            let html = `&lt;div class="${className}" ` +
                       `style="font-weight: ` +
                       `${(selected ? "bold" : "normal")}"&gt;` +
                       `This is a test element&lt;/div&gt;`;
            
            parentNode.html(html);
            </code>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>The left/first implementation constructs the DOM programmatically and takes less code to 
            write in jQuery over an equivalent implementation written in ES6 + DOM. The right/second 
            version uses an HTML templating approach and does not benefit from using jQuery 
            over modern ES6 + DOM. This has lead to a battle where deeply held beliefs are 
            being defended by “Templaters” versus “Structuralists” without surfacing the 
            underlying assumptions.</p>
        <p>Thus the findings are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>jQuery is no longer necessary if you template HTML in Javascript</li>
            <li>Inline templating of HTML in Javascript is still quite risky and is more limiting</li>
            <li>Structural creation of HTML elements benefits greatly from jQuery</li>
            <li>jQuery appears to be at least 30% more code efficient if taking the structural approach</li>
            <li>The application of the two approaches depends on the particular need. There is no one “right” way.</li>
            <li>Templaters and Structuralists could benefit from understanding each other’s viewpoint</li>
            <li>Javascript engineers should understand both approaches and use the method appropriate to their need</li>
        </ul>

            controversy. This time about jQuery.</p>

        <p>This lead to numerous posts about how dead jQuery is and how it has been replaced by recent 
            Javascript features. Many posters referred to these features as ES6, though 
            <code>document.querySelector()</code> is the DOM enhancement most cited.</p>
        <p>I have heard this argument before, but I’ve never understood it. While 
            <code>document.querySelectorAll()</code> can perform the same search as jQuery, it 
            cannot apply a change across all the elements without iterating and updating each 
            element individually. In my mind this provides jQuery with a critical advantage that 
            helps keep code sizes small. So I challenged posters to demonstrate how jQuery has 
            been replaced.</p>
        <p>The results of these challenges were mostly ineffective. The answers either missed the 
            question about updating multiple elements or they dismissed it as unimportant. The 
            mantra was, “I can replace your jQuery with 4 lines of Javascript.”</p>
        <p>This “4 lines of Javascript” claim seemed unlikely, but we weren’t getting anywhere with 
            the conversation. So I tried a different tactic. I setup a 
            <a href="https://github.com/jbanes/versus-js/tree/main/Original">GitHub repo</a> with a 
            minimal benchmark of code to demonstrate my understanding and give others an opportunity to 
            prove their point. I then issued the challenge on X to those I was discussing this with.</p>

        <h3>My goals</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>I want nothing more than for jQuery to be no longer necessary. Make it dead. No replacement. 
            Just built-in browser functionality.</p>
        <p>This point seems to confuse a lot of respondents. I’m not arguing jQuery is superior. I’m 
            arguing that we still haven’t replaced it. Which is massively disappointing to me. When 
            someone says, <i>“I can replace jQuery with 4 lines of Javascript,”</i> I want it to be true! 
            That would be a fantastic world to live in with fewer dependencies and faster development 
            times.</p>
        <p>I don’t believe solutions like React, Vue, or Angular are replacements for jQuery. They are 
            tools for SPA development. An approach which has merit, but I feel is massively overused. 
            In my consulting work I have seen jQuery and related components be far more effective in 
            80-90% of the use cases than React or Angular. Nearly every decision to use the latter were 
            decisions made in error. The applications ended up as a multipage design crammed into a 
            monopage download. Which meant the developers were fighting the very tooling they selected to 
            make their lives easier.</p>
        <p>Contrast this with brand new jQuery deployments. These are typically done very quickly with 
            few conflicts between engineers. The results tend to be very performant and successful. Even 
            when skills are limited. (Hashtag

        <h3>Code Design</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>To facilitate a successful conversation I needed code that represented real-world use cases. 
            Coming from a background in large-scale data analytics, a paginated table is a common 
            component. The component is actually many bundled components consisting of the core table component 
            itself with no controls other than sorting, a paginator component to control page display, 
            and numerous components to manipulate filtering. The components can be composed in various 
            ways to produce an interface tailored to the data set. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div style="margin-top: -1rem;"><img src="franchises.svg" alt="Example mockup of a paginated table interface"></div>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: -3.5rem; margin-bottom: 4rem;"><i>Example of a paginated table interface</i></div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>The components need bi-directional communication to both update the table as well as ensure 
            that changes to the table cause components to update themselves. Distilling this down to 
            the minimum functionality to, I came up with the following page.</p>

    </div>
    <div>
        <p>This maintains the component model, the composability, and minimal bi-directional 
            communication while simultaneously keeping the entire project at under 100 lines 
            of Javascript. It provides a real-world analog without all the complexity of a 
            real-world application.</p>
        <p>I then created a “pure” ES6 version, swapping the jQuery components for Classes. 
            Classes are the idiomatic standard for Web Components and seemed like a good analog 
            to jQuery components, allowing for a like-to-like code comparison.</p>

        <p>Using jQuery resulted in 53% less Javascript and 36% smaller file size over ES6. The 
            jQuery code achieves this through a much higher code density.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="productivity">
        <h3>Download Size vs. Productivity</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Download size is obviously a concern for any web developer. Smaller downloads can lead 
            to faster initial page loads by optimizing network time. However, it is only one axis 
            of analysis.</p>
        <p>As I pointed out in the original analysis and is made clear by the table above, the 
            smaller jQuery size only matters if an application is scaled enough to make up for 
            the 70KB of the library. Which is perfectly doable if you cache a single copy of 
            jQuery across pages.</p>
        <p>But that is not the focus of my investigation. </p>
        <p>In fact, it might surprise you to know that you’ve loaded the jQuery library at least 
            5 times when you loaded this page. It’s unlikely you noticed as they are all set to 
            load after the initial page has been retrieved. Thus we can see that code size is not 
            the only method of achieving a better experience.</p>
        <p>Instead, the focus for me is on <b>Productivity</b>. i.e. How fast can a team deliver “correct” 
            code to production. </p>
        <p>Productivity is going to be heavily affected by quality of requirements and proper alignment 
            of technology selection. If and only if these factors are correctly handled will the jQuery 
            vs. ES6 question matter. So this matters to me, but not everyone will share my interest as 
            many have more basic concerns. e.g. If you incorrectly select React despite a misalignment 
            with that technology, no amount of code size improvement will help. Your team will be 
            spending their time fighting their technology stack.</p>
        <p>Assuming all other factors are equal, how do we compare productivity? The best metric we have 
            is lines of code (LOC). As noted in Fred Brooks seminal work <i>The Mythical 
            Man Month</i>, lines of code written across a given time period is a relatively fixed metric. 
            Brooks and his colleagues observed that if the same functionality could be delivered in fewer 
            lines of code the resulting program would be completed faster. And with higher quality 
            since the human errors per KLOC (1000 lines of code) also stays relatively fixed.</p>
        <p>Thus we can infer that the technology producing the fewest lines of code for the same 
            functionality results in greater productivity.</p>
        <p>This observation is very powerful and represents the reason why we moved from Assembly to 
            higher level languages like C/C++, Pascal, Java, Python, etc. The 
            reasoning may seem counter-intuitive at first, but it makes sense when you think about it.</p>
        <p>Which is easier to reason on: CPU registers holding comparison results driving conditional jumps... or a for 
            loop? Most would say “for loop” without batting an eye. It’s just a simpler abstraction 
            than direct manipulation of the hardware.</p>
        <p>With the metric established I drew the following conclusion: In this small benchmark jQuery 
            appeared to be 30-50% more productive.</p>

        <h3>Coding Style</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>The primary issue with using LOC is that the metric is highly sensitive to code style. 
            Most languages have an SLOC (Source Lines of Code) metric that can be used to adapt to 
            various coding styles. For example, Java has NCSS (Non-comment Source Statements) that 
            allows for easy comparison of LOCs. At the time of writing I am unaware of tools to 
            obtain such a metric for Javascript.</p>
        <p>In a best attempt to compensate for this, a 
            <a href="https://github.com/jbanes/versus-js/blob/main/documents/CODESTYLE.md">standardized 
            coding style</a> was used. The chosen style is a pragmatic one, using Allman for general 
            control structures/functions while still allowing practical concessions like single-line 
            control statements. It takes advantage of intentional breaks in normalized styling to 
            communicate information such as anonymous inner functions. This allows for strong 
            readability and fast skimming of code but is inefficient with vertical space. </p>
        <p>The chosen style was intentionally a real-world coding style used by millions of lines 
            of code and numerous teams.</p>
        <p>However, this has unintentionally caused some concerns which will need to be discussed.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="notacodingcompetition">
        <h3>Not a Coding Competition</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Most of the submissions I received seemed to think the goal was to produce the smallest 
            amount of code possible for the minimalist functionality shown on screen. To that end, 
            they typically stripped away the component model and sometimes even modified 
            functionality to make it easier to reduce code sizes. The code was small 
            while lacking any form of reusability. It proved nothing about jQuery versus ES6 
            approaches.</p>
        <p>Trying to correct this misconception was met with fierce negativity, arguing that the 
            code not present reusability and therefore such an argument 
            was invalid. This continues to miss the point. The code is very clearly designed 
            for reusability. Here are 
            <a href="https://github.com/jbanes/versus-js/tree/main/Library">three examples</a> of 
            the code being reused:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="iframes">

        <iframe width="260" height="180" src="https://jbanes.github.io/versus-js/Library/jQuery/alternate.html"></iframe>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>The first two example use the original code with zero changes other than to split the 
            components into their own JS files. Yet we see radically different layouts and 
            experiences due to the HTML and CSS layouts.</p>
        <p>The third example seamlessly swaps the original pager with an alternate implementation 
            and demonstrates how functionality remains. It even goes as far as to make one of the 
            visible pagers a permanent fixture in a bar at the top of the window. The pager will remain 
            visible even if the page were to scroll.</p>
        <p>All of this is to demonstrate the original purpose: real-world analog code that can be 
            updated to demonstrate how jQuery has been made obsolete. The expectation is that any 
            reimplementation would focus on the replacement of jQuery. Not on trying to make as 
            tight of code as possible. Something which is rarely the focus of shipping software.</p>

    <div>
        <p>One of the concerns raised was that this was “the most bad faith implementation ever,”
            with the implication that the jQuery code was intentionally written to be smaller than 
            the ES6. The motivation for this claim was apparently the ES6 class accessors versus 
            the jQuery approach of using if/else checks. </p>

    <div>
        <p>On the surface, I can understand how this would cause concern. Especially 
            without the <a href="https://github.com/jbanes/versus-js/blob/main/documents/CODESTYLE.md">coding style</a> explicitly called out. </p>
        <p>However, I think it’s important to understand that this is a comparison of the 
            jQuery methods versus the ES6 methods. Both methods are (to the best of this 
            author’s knowledge) the correct approach for the technology.</p>
        <p>The if/else block is an idiomatic approach for handling jQuery commands to 
            plugins. Calling <code>$(element).pagedContent("page")</code> to obtain the current page 
            and <code>$(element).pageContent("page", 3)</code> functions exactly the same as 
            <code>$(element).css("font-weight")</code> and 
            <code>$(element).css("font-weight", "bold")</code>. I do not see any issues 
            with the correctness of this implementation. It does take advantage of single-line 
            if statements, but that is in many ways demonstrating an advantage of the 
            jQuery approach: density of logic.</p>
        <p>Some argued that the getters/setters on the class were unnecessary resulting in code 
            sizes being blown out. Why couldn’t I just call <code>object.page</code> and 
            <code>object.page = 3</code>? </p>
        <p>I must say that I initially thought I might have made a mistake here. I remembered 
            that I had run into a problem, but I couldn’t immediately recall what the issue was. 
            I revisited and remembered why this approach was used. </p>
        <p>The problem stems from the need for a setter on <code>page</code>. Updating the page 
            is supposed to call <code>render()</code>. Without a setter this change will not 
            happen. To be symmetrical I need both a getter and a setter on <code>page</code>. 
            With a getter/setter for <code>page</code>, it seemed to make sense to provide a 
            getter for <code>pages</code> so that the API remains consistent. I honestly 
            believe that this is the “correct” way to handle this and is how it would be 
            implemented in real-world software.</p>
        <p>However, I made an attempt at 
            <a href="https://github.com/jbanes/versus-js/blob/main/Original/ES6/alternate.html">rework to  
            eliminate the getters/setters</a>. This version exposes a single method to update the current 
            page with the <code>page</code> and <code>pages</code> properties acting as read-only values. 
            There is no enforcement of this making it a somewhat more dangerous approach. But it does 
            drop the code size of the ES6 version from 94 to 83 lines. Still 46% more code than the 
            jQuery version, but better. Not a major win though.</p>
        <p>The next most persuasive argument is the number of empty lines in the render function of 
            <code>PagedContent</code>:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="codeblocks">
        <code class="javascript" start-line="41" min-width="576px">
        render()
        {
            let page = this.page;

            this.elements.forEach(function(element, index) {
                let info = document.createElement("div");

                info.textContent = "Page " + page;

                element.replaceChildren(info);
            });
        }
        </code>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>This is quite a bit larger than the jQuery version which ended up so small 
            it fit on a single line (Line 27):</p>
    </div>
    <div class="codeblocks">
        <code class="javascript" start-line="22" min-width="576px">
        if(operation === "page" &amp;&amp; value) this.data("page", value);
        else if(operation === "page") return this.data("page");
        else if(operation === "pages") return this.data("pages");

        //Render
        this.empty().append("&lt;div&gt;").text("Page " + this.data("page"));
        </code>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>There was no intent to defraud here. The task was so simple in jQuery that it fit 
            within a single 80-character line. You can see that in comparison to the if 
            statements above it is nearly the same size. Though it turns out there is a bug 
            in line 27 that did not affect functionality. The corrected code adds 3 
            characters and is still within 80 characters in total. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="codeblocks">
        <code class="javascript" start-line="26" min-width="576px">
        //Render
        this.empty().append($("&lt;div&gt;").text("Page " + this.data("page")));
        </code>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Arguably, my unnecessary <code>// Render</code> comment handed the ES6 version an extra line to 
            work with. And this isn’t the only time the ES6 version is getting a bone thrown.</p>
        <p>If we look at the rendering for the pager, we can see line-wrapping on the jQuery call starting at line 39:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="codeblocks">
        <code class="javascript" start-line="37" min-width="576px">
        function createPage(page, selected)
        {
            return $("&lt;span&gt;")
                        .addClass("page" + (selected ? " selected" : ""))
                        .text(page)
                        .click(function() {
                            content.pagedContent("page", page);
                            that.pager(content);
                        });
        }

        this.empty().append($("&lt;span&gt;").text("Page: "));

        for(let i=0; i&lt;pages; i++)
        {
            this.append(createPage(i+1, (page === i+1)));
        }
        </code>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>We can see a similar statement in single-line form on line 48. The otherwise single-line <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> 
            creation on line 39 is wrapped to at least 3 lines more than necessary. And no 
            attempt was made to condense lines 50-53 into a single-line for loop.</p>
        <p>The real reason why the ES6 is so much larger is because the current DOM APIs lack 
            the ability to chain operations like jQuery. This results in separate statements 
            for creating an element, setting the text content, and then replacing the contents of 
            the parent element. Without the relatively new <code>element.replaceChildren()</code> 
            even more code would have been required to empty the parent element.</p>
        <p>Which gets to the core of my argument. The jQuery code is naturally more dense. Not due 
            to coding style or explicit decisions made to write tighter code. But due to a couple 
            of inherent features in jQuery:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Chaining of operations</li>
            <li>Operations apply to the entire set without an explicit iteration</li>
            <li>Compact component model</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Just to punctuate this point, an attempt was made to minimize the code to demonstrate 
            the “bad faith” supposedly on display. Instead of demonstrating bad faith it showed 
            that the Javascript was still ~30% smaller after minification:</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="minified.png" style="width: 80%;" alt="jQuery 716 bytes; ES6 1.0 kilobyte">
        </p>
        <p>Hopefully I have demonstrated that this was a fair comparison by all measures and that 
            every decision was made in good faith. I don’t mean that my point was inherently proven. 
            Only that the setup was fair for discussion. Given the reputational damage associated 
            with a “bad faith” accusation, I politely request a retraction by those who made or 
            explicitly amplified this accusation. It’s not required, but it would be appreciated.</p>
        <p>With that out of the way let’s talk about how Travis Wagner proved that jQuery is dead... 
            and simultaneously shows that the original findings were correct.</p>

    <div id="findings">
        <h2>Findings</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>As mentioned in the Overview, most of the submissions reached a smaller 
            size by deleting the component model and otherwise focusing on “cleverness” to produce 
            less code.</p>
        <p>This was not intended as a coding competition. The goal was to show a 
            minimum example of code that represented a real-world use case to see if the advantages 
            of jQuery could be replicated or replaced.</p>
        <p>None of the submissions achieved this until I received a submission by Travis Wagner. 
            Arguably, Travis’ submission didn’t truly prove that jQuery is dead. Rather, it 
            brought into sharp relief that there are two sides to the argument. And both happen 
            to be correct. </p>

        <p>Travis Wagner’s submission was impactful because it clearly showed the other side 
            of the argument and why we appear to be disagreeing in the first place. It turns 
            out that there are two radically different ways of writing jQuery. You will land 
            in one camp or the other depending on your preferred approach. This difference in
            approach becomes the basis for disagreement.</p>

        <p>In an effort to clear perceived issues with the original coding style, Travis used a 
            K&R-based style with no vertical space except for separation of functions. While this 
            doesn’t quite match a real-world style (vertical spacing around control structures is 
            very common), it’s fully within the bounds of the conversation. I had repeatedly 
            stated that any style is fine as long as both versions use the same style for

        <h3>Semantic Differences & Adjustments</h3>

    <div>
        <p>While I’m unsure if it was intentional or not, Travis’ version introduced configurable 
            values for the <code>page</code> and <code>pages</code> settings in the pagedContent 
            component. This was accomplished by adding the <code>data-page</code> and 
            <code>data-pages</code> attributes on the HTML tag and then updating <code>data-page</code>  
            as the page is updated by the pager. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="codeblocks">
        <div>
            <code style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: SF Mono, monospace;">

    &lt;div id="top_pager" class="pager"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div id="content" class="paged-content" <span style="background-color: #f4b759;">data-page="1" data-pages="5"</span>&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            </code>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>While the number of pages would be computed in the real world by the data passed 
            into the component (thus the use of a hard coded value as a stand-in) there’s 
            nothing wrong with this implementation as a configurable value. The initial state 
            of <code>data-page</code> also allows a default page other than 1 to be used. Which could be 
            useful for remembering state between page transitions.</p>
        <p>To ensure that both implementations match as closely as possible, I implemented this 
            default values feature in the jQuery version. It ended up not affecting the analysis

        <p>Travis’ submission had one major bug and one minor design issue that I strongly 
            feel should be fixed. Here is Travis’ original submission. Click the “Page:” 
            text to the left of the numbers to see what happens:</p>

        <p>The “Page NaN” result is due to two factors. The first is that everything in the 
            pager bar is a click target. (Lines 36 & 37) This means if you click on “Page:” 
            or an empty space outside the numbers you’ll activate the click handler.</p>
        <p>The second and more minor issue is that the code is parsing the page value from 
            the text content. (Line 38) This is using the rendered text as state data, 
            limiting the ability of the code to detect valid clicks. </p>

        <p>After reporting these to Travis, I did a quick bug fix on these two issues to resolve the

        <p>The fix works by moving the state of the page number to an attribute on the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> 
            tag, and then detecting if the attribute exists. In the case of a missing attribute 
            it falls back to the currently rendered page number.</p>

    </div>
    <div id="componentmodel">
        <h3>Component Model</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Travis’ implementation has a weak component model implemented by related functions. 
            The <code>renderPagedContent()</code> / <code>createPagedContent()</code> and 
            <code>renderPagination()</code> / <code>createPagination()</code> functions can 
            be grouped together into JS files to represent each component’s interface. The 
            use of the top-level namespace for functions is less than ideal, but it works.</p>
        <p>However, the specific implementation submitted does have a few problems with 
            maintaining this model. </p>
        <p>The most egregious is the direct update of the pagedContent element in the middle 
            of the <code>createPagination()</code> function. (Line 39)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="codeblocks">
        <code class="javascript" start-line="35">
        function createPagination(paginationEl, pagedContentEl, pagers) {
            paginationEl.innerHTML = renderPagination(Number(pagedContentEl.dataset.page), Number(pagedContentEl.dataset.pages));
            paginationEl.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
                const curr = Number(e.target.textContent);
                pagedContentEl.innerHTML = renderPagedContent(curr);
                pagedContentEl.dataset.page = String(curr);
                pagers.forEach((el) => (el.innerHTML = renderPagination(curr, Number(pagedContentEl.dataset.pages))));
            });
        }
        </code>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>This could have been mitigated by moving line 40 above line 39 and replacing line 39 
            with a call to <code>createPagedContent()</code>. This would have used the 
            exposed component function, deduplicating functionality and creating better 
            separation of concerns.</p>
        <p>This still leaves an issue of a secondary channel of communication through the 
            <code>data-page</code> and <code>data-pages</code> attributes. There are a few ways 
            to mitigate this, but it isn’t required if the attribute approach for 
            communication is clearly documented for the components. It’s not fundamentally 
            different than using class attributes. Just a weaker association between the 
            function calls and the data objects. i.e. It is less “encapsulated” into a 
            single concept.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="subjectiveopinion">
        <h3>Subjective Opinion</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>The most eye opening discovery from Travis’ submission is that I simply was not 
            looking at the problem from his perspective. Just as, I assume, he wasn’t looking 
            at it from mine.</p>
        <p>To be clear, I would never implement a webapp this way. Many of the techniques 
            used in this code were explicitly banned on my teams. This was due to the 
            perceived risks carried by these techniques.</p>
        <p>The most fundamental problem I have is the extensive use of <code>innerHTML</code> for 
            rendering. This requires constant validation of types and content to prevent 
            injection attacks from occurring. One little slip up and you could be exposing 
            your users to Javascript injection attacks.</p>
        <p>We can see there are <code>Number()</code> and <code>String()</code> casts littered 
            everywhere in an attempt to ensure the correct type:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="codeblocks">
        <code class="javascript" start-line="35" highlight="Number,String">
        function createPagination(paginationEl, pagedContentEl, pagers) {
            paginationEl.innerHTML = renderPagination(Number(pagedContentEl.dataset.page), Number(pagedContentEl.dataset.pages));
            paginationEl.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
                const curr = Number(e.target.textContent);
                pagedContentEl.innerHTML = renderPagedContent(curr);
                pagedContentEl.dataset.page = String(curr);
                pagers.forEach((el) => (el.innerHTML = renderPagination(curr, Number(pagedContentEl.dataset.pages))));
            });
        }
        </code>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>In fairness, these casts are also functional in many cases. The casts ensure the 
            proper type is set so that math or string concatenation doesn’t go sideways. </p>
        <p>Which points to my secondary concern. This code leaks state all over the place. 
            On line 38 we see the current page number being parsed from the content of the 
            <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tag. Which means that the display content is now data. </p>
        <p>This works as long as our rendering and our data match. Any update that changes the 
            format of the page numbers would immediately fail and need to be redesigned. e.g. 
            prefixing the word “Page” to the number, using graphics, glyphs from an icon library, etc.</p>
        <p>As I previously demonstrated the state could be improved by setting a tag attribute 
            in the same manner pagedContent does. Using closure to trap the 
            value would be even better, but the template-based rendering precludes that 
            as an option.</p>

                                that.pager(content);

            }
            </code>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>To be fair, it is not always possible to use a closure technique. Drop-downs 
            are a good example where some form of identifier for the value has to be 
            carried in the options array. Either the <code>selectedIndex</code> is used 
            directly or a value is stored in the <code>&lt;option&gt;</code>.</p>
        <p>To reiterate, this is my subjective opinion and the way I prefer to design applications. 
            This is not a reflection on the quality of the work or anyone who writes 
            Javascript this way. The only reason we are discussing my opinion is that it 
            gets to the heart of why we are disagreeing on whether jQuery is 
            replaced. </p>

    <div id="objectiveanalysis">
        <h3>Objective Analysis</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Now that the dust has settled we can see that there are two clear approaches to writing jQuery:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The “Structuralist” approach where tags are created and combined procedurally. 
                This approach is quite safe as HTML is never injected into the page. User 
                information injected into the page is always handled as text, preventing an 
                entire class of injection and cross-site scripting attacks. The tradeoff is code 
                density.</li>
            <li>The “Templater” approach where snippets of HTML are created and injected into 
                the page using the <code>.html()</code> function of jQuery. Templating provides high 
                code density and clear visual explanation of what HTML is going to be modified and 
                how. The tradeoff is inherent code safety.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>What I find interesting about this split is that it is only a split in thinking. Not a 
            true split in actual practice. Most code bases I’ve seen in the wild will combine these 
            methods as appropriate. </p>
        <p>Those who fall into the “Templater” camp will often find that complex, configuration-driven 
            rendering is easier to accomplish with structural changes responding to the configuration 
            rather than trying to if/else their HTML templates. It's also higher performance for
            when that matters.</p>
        <p>Those who fall into the “Structuralist” camp may find the occasional small HTML 
            injection safe enough and may even rely on server-side templates (e.g. JSP, ASP, 
            PHP, etc.) for initial-state rendering. Server side templating carries all the
            same risks as client-side templating.</p>
        <p>With this in mind we can now answer the original question.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="jqueryrequired">
        <h3>Is jQuery no longer required?</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>If your thinking aligns to <i>Structuralist</i> thinking, jQuery has yet to be replaced 
            by current DOM technology. You will be writing more code overall, but it appears 
            you can obtain ~30% productivity improvement by using jQuery. Additionally, I 
            find the component libraries remain quite compelling. </p>
        <p>If your thinking aligns to <i>Templater</i> thinking, then jQuery is a dead 
            technology to you. You will find everything you need in the current ES6 + DOM 
            APIs. Some jQuery components may remain appealing. But I expect you’re 
            looking towards Web Components and other non-jQuery approaches for 
            component solutions. You may already have embraced a component library 
            solution like React. Even if it drives a Single Page Application (SPA) 
            approach in the bargain.</p>

        <h2>State of Discourse</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>This entire process was quite interesting and informative. While it was my goal 
            to engage in intelligent discourse, the conversation branched a number of 
            directions. Many of which feel like cause for concern.</p>
        <p>First I want to say that truly curious and engaged engineers are still around. 
            Taking a look at the <a href="https://github.com/jbanes/versus-js/pulls">PRs</a>, 
            <a href="https://github.com/jbanes/versus-js/forks">Forks</a>, and 
            <a href="https://github.com/jbanes/versus-js/issues">Issues</a> of the project 
            shows all kinds of creative implementations. From Web Components to Umbrella JS to 
            React, and many more! While they don’t necessarily answer the question of 
            if jQuery is dead (many are even larger than the original ES6 implementation!) 
            they generate interesting conversations of their own.</p>
        <p>And I am totally here for it. These are my kinds of people. 😎</p>
        <p>Of greater concern was the sheer number of Ad Hominem attacks I experienced. I 
            received claims of never having written serious code in my life, completely 
            not knowing what I am doing because I’m not automatically embracing the latest 
            framework, and my favorite: Being just plain “retarded” for bringing it up in 
            the first place.</p>
        <p>Looking back at these posts I’ve made some intriguing discoveries:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The X algorithms do eventually push better and/or more useful responses to the 
                forefront. This is partly based on the community engagement with posts which 
                drive the best content upwards. A cursory examination of the thread would find 
                limited evidence of my concerns about poor quality responses. Which I think is 
                overall a good thing for the conversation.</li>
            <li>Relatively few people actually read the 
                <a href="https://github.com/jbanes/versus-js/tree/main/Original">original 
                analysis</a>. This is easy to see by the clamoring of “but you didn’t include 
                the 70KB for the jQuery library!” Actually I did include that in my analysis. 
                Which means that the majority of respondents wanted to react to the headline 
                without engaging with the content of the analysis. This is probably to be 
                expected on a platform like X/Twitter, which is founded on limited attention 
                and engagement.</li>
            <li>While it’s difficult to prove, I got the sense that many of the poor quality 
                responses came from inexperienced developers and engineers. This makes 
                sense as they are just beginning their careers and believe that they have 
                learned the One True Way&trade; to successfully engineer a project. We’ve all 
                been there. I expect they will ultimately mature.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>One could argue that this is my own fault for starting a serious technical 
            conversation on X. Which is fair. But also raises the question: Where can we have 
            this conversation?</p>
        <p>Once upon a time we had web forums that facilitated discussions. Moderators would 
            step in to discourage contentless posts that merely sought to attack or disparage. 
            This encouraged well-thought out posts leading to more engaging conversations.</p>
        <p>I was an early member of many of these back in the day. JavaLobby, OSDev, JavaGaming.org, 
            and AtariAge all come to mind as past examples of such forums. </p>
        <p>Today’s social media apps like X, Reddit, and Discord may have less “gatekeeping”, but I’m not 
            sure we are better for it. Sometimes the younger generation needs to lurk and learn 
            from the conversations of those more senior to them.</p>
        <p>Additionally there’s the problem of interpreting tone. Conciliatory and respectful are 
            difficult tones to convey in the written word. I expect many read my words in a more 
            hostile tone than intended. Just as I likely read their statements with more 
            hostility than they intended.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, I don’t know how to solve this. All I can do is to remind myself and others
            that we’re all on the same side. We want to create better software while lowering the cost of 
            creating that software. Can we work to facilitate those conversations rather than

        <p>In the end I think I learned a lot about the discourse around jQuery as well as its 
            position in the market. We’re all arguing past each other because we’re not 
            understanding each other’s positions. </p>
        <p>I want to thank Travis Wagner for sticking with the discussion / argument and getting 
            us to clarity. And thanks to everyone else who participated in the discussion! I 
            really do appreciate the time and I hope everyone else learned as much from this 
            as I did.</p>
        <p>Whether you are a Structuralist or a Templater, I think we have a lot to share if 
            we can understand each other’s viewpoints. For my part I will keep using jQuery 
            where it makes sense. And I expect others will continue to ignore it as “dead 
            tech”. And that’s okay. </p>
        <p>I expect the next major shift is not too far around the corner. Maybe it will be 
            Web Components. Maybe it will be something else. Just please take the time to 
            evaluate the technology and make sure you’re using it for the right reasons. 
            Software Engineering was never meant to be a popularity contest.</p>
